Stacks and queues are data structures used in computer science to organize and manage data.

Stack:LIFO (Last In, First Out): The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates where you always take the top one.Operations: "push" (to add an element) and "pop" (to remove the top element).

Queue:FIFO (First In, First Out): The first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Imagine a line of people waiting; the person who arrived first gets served first.Operations: "enqueue" (to add an element) and "dequeue" (to remove the front element).

Both are fundamental in various algorithms and applications for managing and processing data in a structured way.
